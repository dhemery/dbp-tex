The utf8cseq.tex file
maps the appropriate UTF-8 character sequences
to these TeX control sequences.

I must ensure that these are defined.

The utf8cseq.tex file says these are defined
in either plain.tex or t1macro.tex. But a few
are defined in utf8seq.tex

If a control sequence is defined in t1macro.tex,
then it's in the T1 font encoding
and there is nothing more for me to do.

If a control sequence is defined in utf8cseq.tex,
then it has some special meaning (not simply an
output character). Anyway, there's nothing more
for me to do.

If a control sequence is defined in plain.tex,
I will have to define it in my own format file,
given that I am not using plain.tex.
